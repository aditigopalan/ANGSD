## Downloading

The SRA study number linked to the paper of my interest is SRP174612. I found the reads and dowloaded the files using SRA toolkit.

These were the SRA numbers for the runs
```
SRR8375257
SRR8375258
SRR8375259
SRR8375260
```
I then downloaded the files using 
```
spack load sra-toolkit@2.10.7
prefetch SRR8375257

```
I then ran this to download all the reads 

```
 fastq-dump --gzip --skip-technical --readids --read-filter pass --dumpbase --clip SRR8375257
 ```
 
 
## QC

Running fastqc and MultiQC on the downloaded files 

```
spack load fastqc
spack load -r py-multiqc

find . -name "*.gz" | xargs -n 1 fastqc --extract 

multiqc .
```
